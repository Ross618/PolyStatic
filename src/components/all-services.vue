        </p>
        <p>
          Upon arrival at our dedicated recycling facility all waste plastics are hand sorted by our expert staff into material types ready for reprocessing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once sorted the raw waste plastics are reduced in size by our shredding and granulating machinery. These machines are capable of processing any size of materials – from ordinary domestic plastic waste to much larger lumps or spoils from industrial /commercial processes.
        </p>
        <p>
          To maintain our high standards of purity and quality all shredders and granulators have metal detectors fitted to their purpose built conveyor systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This, together with our other reprocessing, ensures that the resulting shredded or granulated plastic material is pure and free from any contamination prior to loading.
        </p>
        <p>
          With our capacity and specialist technology we are delighted to carry out toll work – taking in your scrap plastic and reprocessing it for you.

          <strong>Purpose built wash & separation plants utilising state of the art reprocessing</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          PolyTherm operate to industry leading standards when it comes to the fast, efficient and thorough sorting of plastic materials. Utilising both our own staff’s expert knowledge and experience, together with leading edge technology in the form of our purpose built washing and separation plants, our facility is capable of separating, cleaning and sorting a huge range of waste plastics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon arrival scrap plastic is processed by our custom-built washing and drying plant – it then passes into our unique 3 stage density separation tank. Using a sink/float differentiation process differing polymers and any contaminants are separated for individual handling.
        </p>
        <p>
          The jewel in the PolyTherm crown is surely our purpose built, on site separation plant. Employing the very latest technology this fully automated equipment is capable of sorting by colour, separating plastics by type and even cleaning large volumes of waste or scrap plastics, including:
